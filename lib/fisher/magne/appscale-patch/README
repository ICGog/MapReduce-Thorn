Adding a Thorn as a language option to AppScale demanded changing the
two code files present in this dir.

* common_functions.rb (get_app_info method in appscale-tools)
* helperfunctions.rb (run_app method in appscale/AppController)

Existing solution:

A new application is uploaded to appscale with
appscale-tools/bin/appscale-upload-app. In this process AppScale also
uploads the language of the application. The value of language is set by
probing for the existence of two files: app.yaml and
appengine-web.xml. The concrete method that probes is get_app_info in
appscale-tools/lib/common_functions.rb.

When starting the web application AppScale decides
which runtime system to use based on the language initially retrieved in
get_app_info. The switch on runtime language is performed in
AppController/helperfunctions.rb.


Patched: 

Instead of probing for existence, the runtime language set
based on the value in app.yaml. That file is expected to be in the app
directory of thorn apps.

AppScale runs the thorn interpreter with different arguments, on the
main.th in the app dir.
