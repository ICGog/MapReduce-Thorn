This is a test of before/after.  liber keeps a record of: the total number of
messages processed, and, for each client, the number processed in 'scenic' and
'ugly' mode. 
  tap() ---- return current records.  Start a new record if necessary, in
             scenic mode.
  flap() --- flip modes.
  zap() ---- kill liber.

The counting is all done with before and after functions.
