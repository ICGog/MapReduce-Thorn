This test is mostly about pattern matching on 'from'.
whiff is a server process (an accumulator server, insofar as it 
has any actual point.)  The whiff protocol: 
  * grab whiff's attention with a snag(ph) sync.  ph is a number
    which a zapper will transmit on every message, to provide an additional  
    check that the conversation goes on with the same zapper 'til done.
  * Send sizzle(ph', n) messages, which (a) confirm the ph identity tag, and 
    (b) increment the accumulator by n, and (c) send back the new value.
  * Send a done(ph') message, relinquishing the attention of the server. 

ferny spawns three zapper processes, each of which tries to grab whiff's
attention, add 0,1,2 to it, and relinquish it.  They have some delays in the
middle of that, increasing chances that other zappers will try to snag the 
ferny -- thereby, we hope, testing that they can't.
