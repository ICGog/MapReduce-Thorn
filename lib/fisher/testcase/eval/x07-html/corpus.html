<h2>Strayway [Vheshrame; 18 Trandary 4385]</h2>

<p>
Strayway is my new sky-yacht.  By "new" I don't mean "new as of this year", or
even "new as of this decade".  Which is a very arrogant and Zi Ri thing to
say, but it's true.  By "new" I mean "I've barely managed to enjoy it."
</p>

<p>
I <i>had</i> been planning to buy a used sky-yacht of some fairly ordinary
design, probably birdy or dragony.  I was going to paint it blue as a minor
concession to vanity.  Not <i>quite</i> my own shade of blue.   I'm
not <i>that</i> vain.
</p>

<p>
I made the mistake of mentioning this at dinner in Castle Wrong.  
</p>

<p><b>Everyone:</b><i>"We gasp in horror, Sythyry!  Such a tedious ship would
    not fully express the crucial message, of <b>Behold!  Here comes a mighty
    yet deviant wizard!</b>  Your sky-yacht must be a gaudiness -- 
    a spectacle -- a wonderment -- a flamboyance supreme!"</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"I suppose so..."</i></p>

<p>
So I got an ordinary transvective skyboat, used, and started doing nighttime
enchantments on it. Some illusions, some transformations, some other things,
and some rather tricky Locador stuff.
</p>

<p>
Strayway is now in the form of a seven-armed silver and amber candelabra, with
seven burning candles in its radially-symmetric spirally arms. The body is a
big silvery vase, some fifteen feet tall and ten in diameter (Don't worry,
it's <i>much</i> bigger inside.) The vase depicts certain selected standard
and ordinary scenes from mythology and history which, while undeniably
standard and ordinary artistic themes, if taken together, <i>might</i> suggest
a certain interest in some topics which I am in fact interested in. A bouquet
of greatly magnified flowers sprouts out the top -- or, rather, a greatly
magnified illusion of anything placed in the centerpiece vase on the high
table of the Grand Dining Hall inside. I plan to stick with flowers. Strayway
is drawn by three three-headed antelopes made of green glass and green copper
and green emerald, with scorpion tails ending in lampy gems. (Yes,
of <i>course</i> they breathe fire. (Yes, it's real fire. Why would I make
fake fire?))
</p>

<p><b>Everyone:</b><i>"Oh, no, Sythyry ... you <b>didn't!</b>"</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"Um, actually I did."</i></p>

<p><b>Everyone:</b><i>"The Doom! The utter and highly characteristic
    Doom!"</i></p> 

<p>
This sort of thing is why wizards get a reputation for being eccentric.
Wizards are not actually eccentric.  Wizards simply listen to their friends. 
</p>

<p>
(But I didn't dare show her in public for a decade after that.)
</p>

<p>
Some notable features of Strayway include:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The hull is plated with real silver. Not a <i>lot</i> of real silver, but
  not such a little either. I have a somewhat complex arrangement with the
  Smith's Guild about how much metal I can create. (Most members of the guild
  can create as much metal as they can. As a skilled enchanter, I can make a
  talisman which creates unlimited amounts of metal to sell. As a loyal and
  honorable Smith's Guild member, I do not create unlimited amounts of metal
  to sell. ... but I still <i>have</i> the talisman, and I can use it for
  things which I promise not to sell for a thousand years. Actually it's not
  unlimited creation, just a pound and a half a day, but it was enough to turn
  a thirty-year full-time apprenticeship into a three-year afternoon-only one.)
</li>
<li><b>The doors</b> are not evident from the outside.</li>
<li>The candle flames are real fire. They are provided with braziers for
  burning nice woods, and fireproof cushions for lounging, if one is inclined
  to sit in one and meditate or watch the landscape without much company.  One
  of them has a lectern which renders books fireproof, in case one wishes to
  read.  
</li>
<li>The Grand Dining Hall is pretty grand.  I was trying to see how long I
  could make one room be, and ... it's about three-quarters of a mile long.
  And thirty feet wide. 
</li>
<li>I did an extremely poor job with the interior geography otherwise. The
  interior is best thought of as being divided into eighteen regions
  (corresponding to the eighteen space-expanders I installed). Within a
  region, geometry works as one might expect: if one goes through a door from
  one room to another, walks ten feet, and goes through another door into the
  first room, one ends up about ten feet from where one started. This is
  unlikely to be true if one crosses between regions, and one can get
  thoroughly lost while one is building it, and have to spont <u>Go Home</u>
  to escape from one's own sky-yacht. I installed a regiment of signposts and
  maps. That still proved insufficient for <i>me</i> to find my way around. A
  certain part of the delay in actually leaving for the vacation is the
  necessity of constructing and providing guides.
</li>
<li> Accordingly, each room has a sentient, mindful item of furniture, capable
  of giving directions and other useful advice.  The Grand Dining Hall has one
  by each door.  
</li>
<li>The pilot's room is an utterly standard and ordinary any-species sort of
  control room.  It is not one bit rococo.  I did not modify it, except to add
  a scrying device. Oh, and I replaced the quick-escape device.  The original
  Strayway (which was called something tedious at that point) had a one-use
  teleporter for escaping from danger.  (She got into danger, got badly clawed
  up, teleported away, and got sold second-hand.)  I can do better, and I did
  do better. And my "better" even works with all the other Locador on the
  yacht ... though we shouldn't use it <i>too</i> often.
</li>
<li>The pantry is provided with a device that prevents foods from spoiling. It
  does not prevent them from <i>aging</i>, though, so we can make our own
  cheese and wine, if we want.
</li>
<li>I didn't make any animata or other mindful servants, though. I thought
  about it, of course. One rarely sees an eccentric wizard without an animated
  floating teakettle with seven leather whips as tentacles, or something like
  that, where a less skillful nobleman would hire a Khtsoyis porter. I decided
  that -- as with Castle Wrong -- I would rather bring friends and people from
  my community along, especially ones who have trouble getting jobs elsewise.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There's more, of course. I have been tinkering with Strayway for two dozen
years or more, in my spare time.  A lot of which was before I actually bought
her, since I knew I was going to by <i>some</i> yacht <i>sometime</i>.
</p>

<h2>Vae [Vheshrame; 12 Trandary 4385]</h2>

<p>
I have any number of other obituaries to write.  I have started on three of
them in the last hour, but they are making me morbid and morose, and I don't
want to be either of those today.  I am going on vacation in a few weeks, as
soon as everything can be arranged!  For the first time in, um, I guess 124
years, since my winter vacation with Floosh's village.
</p>

<p>
Well, not entirely on vacation. I am taking my work with me. My main job,
still, is making sure that Vae doesn't do very much wicked to Vheshrame. Our
relationship has changed a good deal over the decades. When we contend now, it
is no longer as an ant (me) against a tiger (Vae). It is more like a kitten
(me) against a tiger (Vae). Actually, Vae has been quite inoffensive for
nearly two decades, though that is surely over. She has been a boy full-time,
while she and Oixe were trying to conceive. That has now worked; Oixe laid a
fertilized, living egg. Vae got to get one quick glimpse of it through a
scrying spell before Oixe drove him off. Oixe will not let Vae, or any other
nendrai, anywhere near the egg or the child until the child is old enough to
take care of itself. The nendrai incubation period is a century or so, so I am
going to go through another generation of friends before Vae gets to see her
sweetie again. Vae is back to female: back to a winged female serpent, at
that, and utterly miserable. A miserable nendrai isn't quite as dangerous as a
deliriously happy one, but it's pretty close. Taking her away from Vheshrame
for a few years seems like the best idea for all concerned.  It may even make
Vae feel better, which is not something that Vheshrame much cares about, but I
do. 
</p>

<p>
And I suppose I should write about Vae, for anyone coming to this journal for
the first time.
</p>

<h2>Vae</h2>
<a name="vae"/>

<p>
<b>The summary:</b> Vae is one of the most awful and dangerously insane
monsters on the World Tree, especially to her friends. She is an fearsomely
powerful mage. When anyone asks her to help them, she loses all judgment and
does something that might be helpful, generally an an overpowered and
devastating way. She is quite sad. She is one of my best friends anymore,
though I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
</p>

<p>
<b>The details:</b>
</p>

<p>
Vae (short for Vaisessasilmin) is a nendrai, one of three known instances
of <i>Nendrai lacrymosa</i>. (I got to name her species myself though I
consulted with her about it, since I live in Ketheria and people at the heart
of civilization heard about my name first. Nobody else had thought to do it
when we met her, everyone was too scared.) Nendrai are one of the half-dozen
most terrible beasts on the World Tree. They are, in their natural form, bulky
bipedal lizardly people with coarse features, some nine feet tall, with very
long and agile tails. (Some of them, like Oixe, aren't quite like that, but
they're all lizardly and all have those tails.) They have a few minor
advantages, like tremendous vitality. If you stab Vae through the heart with a
huge enchanted burning copper sword hard enough to kill three mighty Gormoror,
she'll grin and speak nicely of your swordsmanship and not
even <i>consider</i> dying like any polite prime would. 
</p>

<p>
The scary part of the nendrai is always the tail.  They can, at a tail-touch,
cast exceedingly subtle and exceedingly powerful spells.  There only a few
restrictions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Vae's spells have complexity 80 and power 160, or, if Locador is involved,
  complexity 
  100 and power 200.  For comparison, a first-rate professional sorcerer, like
  a master smith, might, at the apex of her career, have one or two
  complexity-30 spells, which she casts at power 35 or so.  A spell of
  complexity 40 is several times as good as one of complexity 30, so Vae's 80s
  are ridiculous and her 100s are beyond ridiculous.   There are plenty of
  primes ranked as great wizards (and deserving it) who can't cast
  a <i>single</i> complexity-100 spell, or even an 80.  Vae can cast nearly
  all of them that she can imagine, and she's got a good imagination for such
  things. 
</li>
<li>Vae's spells <i>must</i> involve Mutoc, the Verb of transformation.  She
  has to phrase them as changes, somehow.  This is barely a restriction; she
  can cast a scrying spell, say, by making a leaf change its appearance to
  match the scene she is scrying on. 
</li>
<li>Vae's spells <i>must not</i> involve Healoc, the Verb of healing. 
  This doesn't actually stop her from healing herself.  She is quite happy to
  transform a wounded body into an unwounded one with Mutoc.  Well,
  not <i>quite</i> happy, since doing it with Mutoc hurts intensely, and doing
  it with Healoc is easier (for those who have Healoc) and feels good.  A few
  useful forms of healing are beyond her, like raising the dead. 
</li>
<li>Vae must touch the target of her spell with her tail.  This, too, is
  barely a limitation, given her powers of Locador -- the magic of space and
  position. 
</li>
<li>(Unlike my spells and those of most people, Vae's spells don't cost her anything to cast.)
</li>
<li>(Unlike when I try to improvise spells, Vae improvises spells without
  risking any failure of the spell proper.  She can still do the <i>wrong</i>
  thing -- indeed, she usually does -- but she always does what she intends to do.)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This makes Vae a power to be reckoned with. She's probably not as dangerous as
an average city-state in Ketheria -- though we have never exactly tested that,
and we hope we never have to -- but she is not far off.
</p>

<p>
Much to her sorrow, Vae is not exactly in control of her own mind. She was
designed by the goddess Gnarn, who rules the art of Mutoc and who is vastly
cruel, to be an endless well of troubles for primes. Vae's primary blind spot
is being helpful. If anyone is so foolish as to suggest that they need
assistance to her, Vae will do something that -- in some interpretation --
might be considered helpful. She doesn't realize she's doing it until she's
done it, and it's generally done in a way that's hard to undo. One time, for
example, I complained about the rain. She surrounded me with a spell of
complete protection from liquids, so that they always ran downhill in a great
hurry, and, for liquids alone, "downhill" was always "away from me". That could have
killed me of thirst, if my roommates hadn't found three ways around it, and it
certainly wasted a bottle of expensive brandy.
</p>

<p>
After much doom, I made Vae a pair of magic earmuffs. When she wears them,
they let her hear normally, except that they muffle things that they think she
might interpret as requests for assistance. She can simply ignore that part of
the conversation, or teleport off to a safe space and have the earmuffs report
what was said, or turn them off altogether. They're not perfect, and they do
make conversing with Vae difficult at times, but they cut down greatly on her
accidental helping people to their sorrow.  She usually wears them when she's
with people.
</p>

<p>
Another lack of self-control is that Vae likes to get things from primes. And
the word 'likes' is rather too weak. She got more physical pleasure from me
passing her the salt at dinner than she did from fathering her unborn child,
and that act was as pleasant for her as it is for most people. Once, some
miscreant offered her a bowl of pea soup if she would build him a vast and
well-defended floating mansion. It took her a hundred spells -- a hundred of
her insanely-powerful spells -- but she did it. For soup. She hates this fact
about herself, but she can do nothing about it. Unlike the helpful side, I
don't have any answer for her on it. Indeed, it is official Vheshrame policy
to exploit this flaw to the fullest.
</p>

<p>
My official, if officially unpaid, job in Vheshrame is "Ambassador to Vae". I
have kept peace between us and her since she claimed our territory as her own
territory 125 years ago. Technically, this has entailed visiting her with
gifts every three days, and both of us pretending that it's simply an act of
tribute between military allies. At various times, privately, I have thought
that it was on the edge of rape. Maybe of her, since she doesn't at all like
craving it or enjoying it. Maybe of me, since Duke Conturge forced me to do it
for the first decade or so and I'm the one pleasuring her.
</p>

<p>
Also I am one of Vae's few friends and confidantes. Most people are scared of
her. With plenty of justification, since she once turned all the Cani outside
the city walls for miles around to wheels of cheese in response to a friend's
child complaining that 'the Cani are bugging me!'.  We managed to turn them
back with a few hours' work... but we are lucky that she chose cheese, rather
than ice cream, or it would have been a massacre.
</p>

<p>
Vae hates her arms and legs. When she is sad or in need of a kind of comfort
that is largely unavailable, which is often, she turns into a winged snake.  I
understand this better than most people.  Not that I have any such problem
myself -- I am <i>quite</i> happy with my body -- but my long-gone long-time
lover Mynthe, who was Herethroy, really wanted to be a mammal, and hated
her insectile body.  (At least Mynthe had the sense to ask <i>me</i> to
deal with the problem, not Vae.)
</p>

<p>
Vae's mate is a female nendrai named Oixe. Oixe is a large six-legged
three-headed nendrai with brazinion scales. She's not quite the sorceress Vae
is -- she rarely gets better than complexity 50, which is still insanely
complex. Her spells are more powerful than Vae's though. And she's far, far
better in a fight. On their first date, they had a huge fight to determine
which one would be the boy. Vae lost. Vae was thus male (via an easy Mutoc
spell) whenever they met, and, when they were trying to concieve, male
full-time for many years. I <i>think</i> that, once their child is grown up
and Oixe can endure the company of other nendrai again, they get to have
another fight to determine who's the boy next time 'round. In any case, Oixe
lives a very long way off. Even Vae, whose Locador spells are mighty indeed,
needed to teleport several times to get there.
</p>

<p>
(She's not wholly deprived of all contact with Oixe. They write each other
love-notes  and send them skipping across the World Tree
with devastating Locador spells. They are thoroughly in love, after all.
Still, Gnarn, in her infinite cruelty, has managed to come up with a way to
reproduce that appears to hurt <i>more</i> than the Zi Ri way.)
</p>

<p>
When Vae cries, which is often, her tears are jagged blades of glass that
force themselves out of her eyes.  She then has to heal herself in order to
be able to see again.  With Mutoc, which hurts intensely.  I have offered to
make her an eye-healing talisman, so that it won't hurt, but she always
refuses it.  She doesn't like crying, and prefers to punish herself for it.
We have had this conversation about once a week for a century now.  I think
there is a very practical aspect to it though; I think it adds tiny increments
to her vitality.
</p>

<p>
In any case, I haven't seen Vae with arms and legs since Oixe laid their egg.
Vae writes love-notes to Oixe with a pen in her snake's mouth. Vae is
miserable, and a miserable nendrai is dangerous beyond words. Getting Vae away
from Vheshrame seems like my civic duty, and giving Vae something to think
about and enjoy seems like my duty as a friend. So, she'll be on vacation with
us.
</p>

<h2>Travel Preparations [Vheshrame; 19 Trandary 4385]</h2>

<p>
When a mighty and influential wizard seeks to travel, there are many, many
preparations to be made.
</p>

<p>
Actually, it's not so much the "mighty and influential wizard" bit as the
"travel" bit. Even if this trip turns out short -- two years, say -- I will
still need a fair bit of luggage and accompaniments and sundries and whatnots.
Also, I will end up bringing a fair number of impedimentia, memorabilia,
regalia, penetralia, dementia, catatonia, <strike>gene</strike> and so on.
</p>

<p>
Jyondre points out that it <i>is</i> possible to do laundry in Srineia.  I
somehow do not find this encouraging for how much I will have to bring.
</p>

<p>
Actually, it's not so much about <i>what</i> to bring as <i>who</i>.    If I
were a mighty and <i>unencumbered</i> wizard, I would have a very simple
who-to-bring: 
</p>


<table border="1">

<tr>
  <td><b>Person</b></td>
  <td><b>Role</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Windigar</td>
  <td>Primary pilot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Me</td>
  <td>Primary tourist, auxiliary pilot, spender of the great vat of money</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Vae</td>
  <td>Auxiliary tourist, terrifying ophidian defense grid</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
However, I am a mighty and influential wizard. Or, to be more precise about
it, an influential wizard. By my family's standards I am a credible beginner
of a wizard. Which is pretty good -- my half-sibling Hezimikkinen isn't a
wizard at all; I have far outstripped zir already in magic. On the other paw,
zie more or less rules Vheshrame except when we've got a very strong duke, and
I am patron to a mere fifty-odd people and lose popularity contests inside my
guilds, so I won't claim very influential either.
</p>

<p>
But I <i>am</i> patron to fifty-odd people at Castle Wrong and environs, and
some of them are quite odd indeed.  Indeed, I really can't leave some of them
behind for even a couple of years, not if I hope to see them again when I get
back. 
</p>


<h3>Grinwipey</h3>

<p>
Case in point: my Khtsoyis friend Grinwipey Snudthanks-Elps. Grinwipey doesn't
technically live at Castle Wrong, but he might as well.  He is, in my
technically sophisticated opinion, the best seamstress in Vheshrame. He has a
gift with the needle.  When he embroiders jellyfish on a tunic, passing Orren
feel hungry; and when he embroiders daggers, they check to see if their
fingers are bleeding.  I have been studying needlework for a century and more;
it is a substantial part of my stock in trade; but Grinwipey exceeds me
considerably, after only a few years study.   As a senior member of the
Couturier's Guild, I was his sponsor.  We had a <i>terrible</i> political
struggle to get him in: he was excluded on three votes, and only by dint of
substantial bribes did he manage to squeak in on the fourth.  
</p>

<p>
No matter.  Grinwipey's productions cannot be sold within the city.  Anybody
rich enough to buy them is sophisticated enough to know who made them, and,
thus, sophisticated enough to refuse to buy anything made by a Khtsoyis.
</p>

<p>
He sells some garments abroad -- <i>far</i> abroad, like in Aradrueia.  The
merchants who transport them get a substantial share of the profit.  
</p>

<p>
Mostly, he works for me.  Of <i>course</i> clothing to be enchanted must start
off as the best clothing that can be made (unless, of course, it needs to be
something other).  Honestly, most of the time that degree of perfection is
unnecessary, but I do want people to think of my works as beautiful and
stylish, as well as powerful and effective.  And when a particular and
insanely fussy design is necessary, who would I have do it but Grinwipey?
There is nobody who can embroider a glove with a pitcher full of arrows, using
thread of stinging nettles and brazinion, like Grinwipey.  Besides, he can
heal his tentacles as he sews the nettles, Khtsoyis-style.  
</p>

<p>
So, last year, we had a conversation that went sort of like this:
</p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"I'm planning to go on vacation."</i></p>

<p><b>Grinwipey:</b><i>"Yeah, you go to the pond and get fobrulated by all sorts
    of Orrens and stuff, I stay here and do all the work."</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"A bit further than the city pond."</i></p>

<p><b>Grinwipey:</b><i>"How far do you need to go to find a whimmy-jimmy
    swimmy big enough for you?"</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"Small enough for me, maybe?  Srineia."</i></p>

<p><b>Grinwipey:</b><i>"Aww, what in the name of Mircannis' gobbleblossom
    is Srineia?"</i>  (He is generally rather cruder when trying to sell a
    dress to a count or something, but we are old friends, and he tones down
    his vulgarity considerably for me.)</p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>Explain, explain, explain.</i></p>

<p><b>Grinwipey:</b><i>"So this ain't no little trip of you jump in Vae's
    yamabloonie and pop off there for an afternoon?"</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"No, probably a year or two."</i> (Which was my thought at
  the time.  I am now thinking of longer.)</p>

<p><b>Grinwipey:</b><i>"Well, you have yourself a sparrow-doodle of a fun
    time, Sythyry, 'n don't worry yourself about me, 'k?  Khtsoyis are tough,
    we don't get ground down."</i></p>

<p>
If he were here and not under my protection ... Hezimikkinen would probably
intercede for him the first time as a favor to me.   The second time, maybe
not. The third time, well, you can only call on half-sibling ties so much.  I
probably wouldn't be away for a week before he had gotten kicked out of the
guild, if not exiled from the whole city.  
</p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"Exactly.  Want to come?"</i></p>

<p><b>Grinwipey:</b><i>"Why in the name of Hressh-Huu's squooshy vortex do you
    want a shoggy with you? If this is some way to get into my pants, you
    <b>lose</b>, lizard girl.  I ain't got no pants."</i>  (Grinwipey is not
    the least bit traff.)</p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"Oh, I'm probably going to end up doing some business there
    too.  I'm bringing my whole workshop.  That includes you."</i>
    He pretends to be polite to me.  I pretend I can get him to do what I
    want.</p>

<p><b>Grinwipey:</b><i>"I'll check with the missuz."</i></p>

<p>
She said no.  But that was some time ago.  The missuz is no longer <i>his</i>
missuz, and, indeed, now counts as one of the people who would encourage him
to leave town, on any pretext, or no pretext at all. 
</p>

<h3>Lithia</h3>
<a name="Lithia-intro"/>

<p>
Lithia is sort of the other side of the problem.   
</p>

<p>
Lithia is really my fault.  Not that I cast the spells myself -- not that
I <i>have</i> the spells, and for a good reason.  Targeenniss is a Rassimel
woman; Pleensy is an Orren man. Like many of my friends and associates, their
love transcended both species boundaries and common sense. Unlike many of my
friends and associates, they decided to unite their flesh in a child, rather
than, say, asking a male Rassimal friend to sire a child on Targeenniss on
Pleensy's behalf.   
</p>

<p>
I didn't know.  They didn't discuss it with me.  
</p>

<p>
They <i>did</i> discuss it with each other.  Anyone with any education knows
that <u>The Ritual of the Fertile Union</u> isn't very good for the child.
But they decided that their Transcendent Love, probably augmented by my magic,
would take care of any little problems that arose. 
</p>

<p>
So they got an karcist from the Temple of the Dark Trinity in Oorah Thrassen
to cast it for them.    (Pleensy had borrowed two graces of Mircannis from my
workshop to pay for it, too, though Targeenniss and I didn't find <i>that</i>
out 'til much later.)
</p>

<p>
By the time that Lithia was born, Pleensy had done the traditional Orren trick
of swimming off back to a riverbank fishing village somewhere.  Targeenniss
was no longer terribly confident in the powers of Transcendent Love to get her
through to the birth, much less anything else.   We had to invoke the powers
of a Pretty Good Midwife for that.  (I'm not a good midwife.  I've had all the
Healer's Guild classes in it, but I'm simply not big enough for the physical
part, and, um, rather too liable to curl up in imagined pain at the thought of
reproduction. Or at least wince at a bad time for encouraging the mother.)  
</p>

<p>
And of course Targeenniss didn't mention who the father was to me until it was
no longer concealable, after Lithia was born.
</p>

<p>
Lithia is a shifter hybrid. Lithia switchs back and forth between Orren and
Rassimel, every hour or two. The transformation is painful; she says it feels
like pinching her finger in a door, only all over, if she isn't using numbing
spells. Staying in one shape for too long is even more uncomfortable, though.
We don't numb <i>that</i> pain though, since staying in one shape for too too
long can be fatal.
</p>

<p>
Some people say that it is a mercy that the constant transformations are
rather bad for her body. Based on Healer's Guild books and some tests, I
estimate that she will probably see her 40th birthday, but probably not her
45th. [25 - 30 Earth years.]
</p>

<p>
She's thirty now.
</p>

<p>
Targeenniss hasn't been the best mother to her.   Targeenniss has confessed to
me that she sees in Lithia her own stupidity and blindness; that she has
condemned Lithia to a short and terrible incarnation for no better reason than
her own obsession.  Targeenniss has, in fact, contrived to spend nine of the
last thirty years away from Castle Wrong, leaving Lithia to be tended by me
and my other associates.   
</p>

<p>
(Castle Wrong has, at any given time, two or three dozen people who cannot
live in their proper place for more or less time. Mostly they are variations
on doomed traff love stories. They come to me, for every traff cafe on the
branch knows about Castle Wrong. I help them as best I can, which often is by
providing them a safe and comfortable place to stay, with people who
understand, and a job. Often the job is inside of Castle Wrong. I paid quite
well to tend young Lithia. No baby is exactly <i>easy</i> all the time, but
Lithia was the most miserable one I have ever dealt with, hurting so much so
often.)

<p><b>Targeenniss:</b><i>"I hear you're going on vacation."</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"Sooner or later.  Sooner, I hope."</i></p>

<p><b>Targeenniss:</b><i>"A long vacation."</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"Some years."</i></p>

<p><b>Targeenniss:</b><i>"Do me a kindness ... or, if I don't deserve a
    kindness, do one for my daughter."</i></p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"What, does she still want to go to Vheshrame
    Academy?"</i></p>

<p><b>Targeenniss:</b><i>"Not that favor. That won't do her any good."</i>
  (Since Lithia would die a few years after graduating (among other reasons),
  nor Targeenniss nor the Academy nor I are particularly eager for her to go
  there, though I have sent some other children from Castle Wrong.) <i>Bring
  her with you. She'll get to see the world, and enjoy a great deal.</i> </p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"Before world and enjoyment are ripped away from her."</i>  I
  no longer glare at Targeenniss about Lithia, but I cannot be wholly kind to
  her any more.</p>

<p><b>Targeenniss:</b><i>"And she can't stay here; it's not safe."</i></p>

Which is also true.  Most primes consider shifter hybrids to be perversions of
the natural order and the divine plan.   It is hard to argue with this, since,
when the topic has been mentioned to them, the gods also consider shifter
hybrids to be perversions of the natural order and the divine plan.

The main disagreement is about where the blame lies. My opinion is that it is
Targeenniss and Pleensy's fault, plus the fault of the ritual mages of Oorah
Thrassen. Theologians generally agree that it's Gnarn's fault, as the dominant
goddess of the ritual and a major force for cruelness in the universe; the
ritual needed to <i>exist</i> for consistency, but did not need to be
so <i>easy</i>. The popular opinion is that it is somehow Lithia's fault:
shifter hybrids are <i>everyone's</i> both-females, and deserve every
punishment for what they are.

It's not really safe for Lithia to be seen too much in public. In particular,
she shouldn't be seen shifting in public.  When I'm around and active, she
gets some protection as the ward of the nendrai-taming wizard.  When I'm away,
well, "ward of the wizard who will probably back in a couple years or so" isn't
nearly as much protection.
</p>

<p>
Besides, I am more next of kin to Lithia than Targeenniss ever was.  
</p>

<p><b>Me:</b><i>"I should be glad if Lithia travelled with me."</i></p>

<p>
Targeenniss looked relieved.  It is much more convenient for her this way.
</p>

<p><b>Targeenniss:</b><i>"I'll go tell her straightaway, then, that she'll be
    going away."</i></p>

<p>
Targeenniss can't be wholly kind to Targeenniss any more, either.
