<h2>Strayway [Vheshrame; 18 Trandary 4385]</h2>

<p>
Strayway is my new sky-yacht.  By "new" I don't mean "new as of this year", or
even "new as of this decade".  Which is a very arrogant and Zi Ri thing to
say, but it's true.  By "new" I mean "I've barely managed to enjoy it."

I don't actually own the Glorious Jubliant Trumpet!
