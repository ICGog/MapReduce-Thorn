1. There should be a control structure for %first.  The idiom 
      if( %first(x %none null | STUFF) ~ +x)  {YES} else {NO}
   is possible, but dorfy, and this is a pretty common case.  Why not just: 
      %%first(STUFF) {YES} else {NO}
   with the YES clause having the bindings from STUFF?

2. "foo".file() should be replaced by File("foo"), etc.

3. We should have an object -> record function (or two: one that supplies type
   info, one that just gives a record).  We probably should have a
   record->object one as well.  
   - Subtle issues here: what to do with nested objects? With cycles?

4. Field visibility may be a concern -- I use visible fields a fair bit.

5. We need better trapping for "connection refused" and other exceptions.

6. We need some way to deal with messages that can't be delivered.
