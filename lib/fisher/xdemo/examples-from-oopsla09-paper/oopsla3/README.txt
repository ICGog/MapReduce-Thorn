To run this example (assuming that Thorn is properly installed): 

Start up three shell windows on this directory.

(1) Start the registry in one window: 
    ./1

(2) Start Venus -- the process which spawns several others -- in another
    window: 
    ./2

(3) Start Kim in a third window: 
    ./3

./1 and ./2 are silent.  ./3 prints: 
  Kim gets a date with {:date:Pat:}!
