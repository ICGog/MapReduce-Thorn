To run this example (assuming that Thorn is properly installed): 

Start up three shell windows on this directory.

(1) Start the registry in one window: 
       % ./run-server

(2) Start the date service in another window: 
       % ./run-dater

(3) Start Kim in a third window: 
       % ./run-kim

Kim will print some messages indicating sensible behavior: 
  Registering porpoise: Porpoise, welcome to DateService!
  Date for porpoise: {:date:Whale:}
  Date for porpoise: {:fail:Sorry, you've dated everyone matching your profile:}
