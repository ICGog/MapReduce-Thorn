Secret Santas (#2)

Honoring a long standing tradition started by my wife's dad, my friends all play a Secret Santa game around Christmas time. We draw names and spend a week sneaking that person gifts and clues to our identity. On the last night of the game, we get together, have dinner, share stories, and, most importantly, try to guess who our Secret Santa was. It's a crazily fun way to enjoy each other's company during the holidays.

To choose Santas, we use to draw names out of a hat. This system was tedious, prone to many "Wait, I got myself..." problems. This year, we made a change to the rules that further complicated picking and we knew the hat draw would not stand up to the challenge. Naturally, to solve this problem, I scripted the process. Since that turned out to be more interesting than I had expected, I decided to share.

This weeks Ruby Quiz is to implement a Secret Santa selection script.

Your script will be fed a list of names on STDIN. An example might be:

Luke Skywalker <luke@theforce.net>
Leia Skywalker <leia@therebellion.org>
Toula Portokalos <toula@manhunter.org>
Gus Portokalos <gus@weareallfruit.net>
Bruce Wayne <bruce@imbatman.com>
Virgil Brigman <virgil@rigworkersunion.org>
Lindsey Brigman <lindsey@iseealiens.net>

Note: If you cannot tell, I made those addresses up and you'll need to replace them with something meaningful. Please don't pester those people, should they happen to be real.

The format for these names is:

FIRST_NAME space FAMILY_NAME space <EMAIL_ADDRESS> newline

We'll keep things simple and say that people only have two names, so you don't have to worry about tricky names like Gray II.

Your script should then choose a Secret Santa for every name in the list. Obviously, a person cannot be their own Secret Santa. In addition, my friends no longer allow people in the same family to be Santas for each other and your script should take this into account.

Output is obvious. E-mail the Santa and tell them who their person is.

The extra credit for this quiz is to convince all your friends how much fun this can really be, so you can put your script to good use. Go forth spreading holiday cheer into the world!
