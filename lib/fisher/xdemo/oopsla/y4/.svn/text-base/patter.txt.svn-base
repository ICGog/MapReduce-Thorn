Let's develop a MMORPG -- that's "Minimally Multiplayer Online Role-Playing
Game"....

 Adverbial Adversaries! Ping Pong 

Two players play a round of ping-pong. 
When the ball comes to you, you may: 
  (a) type an adverb (e.g. "angrily") describing how you return the ball.
  (b) type a blank line to miss the ball.
